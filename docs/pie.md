## PXE

Computer rooms located at Villejuif or Le Kremlin-Bicêtre are available at any
time - day and night. Other computer rooms may have specific schedule depending
on their location. The machines have no hard drive, they boot via the network
using PXE (Preboot Execution Environment).

A menu is proposed with an archlinux session. Archlinux is the operating
system chosen by the school.

## Live session

The archlinux image evolves through the year to allow students to realize
their projects.

The image is loaded in the memory. Which means that the entirety of the
modifications made outside of the AFS folders are lost on reboot.

## Epita account

An "epita" account, without any password, is available at any moment. It allows
one to quickly log in on a computer, even without network (if it is already
started, obviously). It is strongly recommended to turn off the computer after
using this account to avoid people from retrieving data by re-logging on it.

## Student session

Each student has a session on the network. To log on it, one has to use his
login and his "epita" [password](passwords.md).

Personal folders are stocked on [AFS](afs.md). It is essential to read this
topic.
