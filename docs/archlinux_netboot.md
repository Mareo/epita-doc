# Linux netboot

Archlinux is the operating system chosen by the school. It is directly available from the network boot (see [IT Workstation](pie.md))

The archlinux image evolves through the year to allow students to realize projects.

The image is loaded in the memory. Which means that the entirety of the modifications made outside of the AFS folders are lost on reboot.
