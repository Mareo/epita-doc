There are currently no printers available directly for students in the KB's campus. However, you can ask the 
administration to print documents for you. You can ask *Pedro Miranda*, *Marion Ormancey* or *Sandrine Caurand*,
who are located in the ING secretariat (see [Epimap](http://map.epita.eu/map-kb-voltaire-f0.svg) for more
indications).
