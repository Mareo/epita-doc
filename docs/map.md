# Map

CRI's intranet provides an interactive map of the computer rooms. This map
allows you to see the computers used by students in real time, the issues and
the heatmap. The issues on the map are used to replace the missing or broken
equipment, this means that it is important to report issues in order to have
fully functional computer rooms.

The CRI's map can be accessed using menu on the left of the intranet.

## Report a problem

If you are having a problem with a device or the computer you are on, you can
report it using the CRI's map.

Go to the issue tab and click the computer you are using on the map. Describe
the problem as clearly as possible.

## Notes
