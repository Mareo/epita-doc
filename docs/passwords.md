 *  At least 10 characters long
 *  Should have 3 different case (At least one uppercase character, one lower
    case, and one numerical character)

# Changing your Bocal password

Your bocal password cannot be changed manually but it can be regenerated on the
[Bocal intranet](http://console.bocal.org).


# Password recovery

## Recovering your Bocal password

If you lost your Bocal password, which is giving you access to your @epita.fr 
email and wifi, you have to send a reinitialization request following this 
[link](https://console.bocal.org/#/recover).

You will be asked your @epita.fr email, and a confirmation code will be send 
via SMS (or email if you posess an international number). Once this code is 
validated, your new password will be send to you via SMS (or, once again. 
email).

If the phone number kept by the Bocal for password recovery is missing or 
simply erronous, you **must** send a ticket at 
[tickets@cri.epita.fr](tickets@cri.epita.fr) indicating your login and a french
 phone number.
